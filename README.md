**This version is for [ruhohSpec v2.0.alpha](http://ruhoh.com/edge/) and is only compatible with ruhoh 2.0.x**

To install setup ruhoh, use the following steps:

## Usage

### ruby 1.9.2+

Presently ruhoh 2.0.alpha should be bundled using bundler so you can use both ruhoh 1.x and ruhoh 2.x at the same time.

#### Clone the Blog Scaffold

    $ git clone git://github.com/ruhoh/blog.git blog-v2

Checkout **2.0.alpha branch**

    $ cd blog-v2
    $ git checkout 2.0.alpha

#### Get Bundler

Do you have bundler?

    $ bundle -v
    
If it's not found, install it:

    $ gem install bundler
    
More info on bundler: http://gembundler.com/

#### Bundle Install

This blog ships with its own [Gemfile][]. All you need to do is install the bundle.

Navigate to the root of this repository and execute:

    $ bundle install

#### Run Ruhoh from the Bundle

Once the bundle is completed, run:

    $ bundle exec rackup -p 9292

This starts a web server that hosts your blog here: [http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292)

To access the bundled ruhoh (2.0.alpha) you'll need precede your commands with `bundle exec`:

    $ bundle exec ruhoh help

#### Make it Your Own

The origin initially points to: git@github.com:ruhoh/blog.git

To add your own remote, first create a new repository on GitHub. ex: git@github.com:USERNAME/my-ruhoh-blog.git

    $ git remote rm origin
    $ git remote add origin git@github.com:USERNAME/my-ruhoh-blog.git

Now you can add your own content and push it to your repository:

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m 'some new content'

## Upgrading

It's best to first get a fresh blog installed and running locally via bundler as outlined.
Next you'll want to compare your existing ruhoh 1.x blog to the new blog scaffold.

[You can view a comparison of the commits between the two version on GitHub][Compare]

Once you've converted your existing blog, try running it with ruhoh 2.0.x by copying the [Gemfile][] into your existing blog and running it with bundler as outlined above.

When ruhoh 2.0. is officially shipped, you'll be able to download and use it as normal:

    $ gem install ruhoh

But not yet!
