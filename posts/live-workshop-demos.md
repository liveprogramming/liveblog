## Live Demos

We are proud to announce the winners of this year's LIVE programming contest!

We received 14 outstanding live programming demos and had a really hard time selecting the 3 winners. All demos will be presented live at the [LIVE workshop, on May 19, in San Francisco](http://http://liveprogramming.github.com/2013).

## Contest Winners

### 1st Place, [Conception](https://github.com/shurcooL/Conception#conception)

Conception is a programmer's playground that blends ideas from systems such as Code Bubbles and Self, allowing a programmer to manipulate source code, execution, output,
and many other programming artifacts, such as diffs and gists.  Even at an early stage, Conception has many neat ideas.  Watch the video!

### 2nd Place, [CodeHint](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~joel/codehint/)

CodeHint is an excellent example of how ideas from live programming can be extended into mainstream programming environments.
CodeHint supports *predictive programming*, which Tanimoto describes as a "fifth-level" of liveness.
CodeHint does this by simultaneously executing different possible API calls, allowing a programmer to interactively select which new changes to encorporate into the program.

### 3rd Place, [urMus](http://echobin.wordpress.com/2013/04/04/improvisation-on-a-live-coded-mobile-musical-instrument-using-urmus/)

urMus is a collaborative live coding system, which produces a live instrument manipulated by a performer.  The prototype system offers an interesting perspective on 
the production of live coding, as well as opening up interesting possibilities for a collobrative team of programmers to bring something to life.
