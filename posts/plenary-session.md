[LIVE 2013](http://liveprogramming.github.io/2013/) will start with a bang, featuring three speakers with deep roots in the history of live programming.
[Steve Tanimoto](http://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/tanimoto/) will be revisiting his framework on "liveness" and thoughts on new levels and directions.  
[David Ungar](http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-davidungar) and [Randy Smith](http://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=labs:bio:0:118) will be jointly talking about the hugely inspirational systems ARK and Self.  
[Thor Magnusson](http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/staff/thor-magnusson) will be speaking about the history of the live coding music scene and his newest live coding system.

### Steve Tanimoto Revisits Liveness

> Liveness in programming environments generally
> refers to the ability to modify a running program. It can be
> considered as a form of a more general class of behaviors that are
> various forms of information to programmers about what they
> are constructing. This paper gives a brief historical perspective
> on liveness and proposes an extension of a hierarchy given in
> 1990, to now account for even more powerful execution-oriented
> tools for programmers. In addition, while liveness concerns the
> timeliness of execution feedback, considering a broader array of
> forms of feedback is helpful both in better understanding liveness
> and in designing ever more powerful development tools.

Full paper will be posted after conference.

### David Ungar and Randall Smith Reflect on Self

> We were delighted to see a workshop dedicated to Live Programming, 
> as we have been fortunate to have been programming in live environments since 1969, 
> and building them since 1985. Since those early days, many have created environments that rapidly respond to what people do, 
> a tremendous benefit. Systems do indeed feel live when they react on their own to stay a consistent part of the world. 
> We propose here a broader definition of liveness, one that emerges from the design principle of making everything seem real. 
> (After all, reality itself is live.) In any such system, the user must always see the true state of the actual thing, 
> and so the reactive character of liveness emerges naturally. But a deeper feeling of liveness emerges when the user 
> is immersed in an entire world that maintains a consistent physics, when the thing on the screen is supposed to be the actual thing.

### Thor Magnusson on Live Coding and the Threnoscope
![Thor]({{urls.media}}/thor.png)

> This year is the tenth anniversary of organized live coding
> in the arts (see www.toplap.org). Diverse live coding systems,
> festivals, club nights, conference tracks, journal issues, and
> research projects have appeared in the last decade that have
> made this form of practice well known within the fields of art,
> music and science (in particular computer science). With its
> foundation in musical performance, live coding has now
> become common in visual arts, light systems, robotics, dance,
> poetry, and other art forms that can operate with algorithmic
> instructions. This paper introduces a new direction in the field of
> artistic live coding where musical works are presented as pieces
> in the form of a live coding system. The system itself and the code
> affordances become equivalent to score system in an open
> musical work for strong improvisation.
